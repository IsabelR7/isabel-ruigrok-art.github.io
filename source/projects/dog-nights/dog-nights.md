# Dog Nights

This project is highly inspired by David Hockney’s Dog Days (1995). I found pure joy in his work, and I got curious about his creative process. So to find out, I made my own Dog Days where I painted my family's dachshund sleeping in six different poses. In every painting I experimented with different materials. I truly loved this project and I totally understand now how David hockney could paint so many of these dogs.
