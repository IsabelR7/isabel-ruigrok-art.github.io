# Floral Window

![](floral-window-outdoors.jpg)

Painted with acrylics, and added collage technique

This floral window has escaped from its room into the landscape.
Without the walls holding onto it, it stands even more secure on its place.

I find it interesting to manipulate the world behind the glass.
