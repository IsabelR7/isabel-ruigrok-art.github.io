My name is Isabel Ruigrok and I am an artist based in The Netherlands.
I am eighteen years old and currently in my second year of studying at HKU Fine Art.

I like painting with loose dancing brush strokes and imagining the world of the painting I'm working on.
I like when things have stories, and where craftsmanship tells them.

I see Nature as something above me, as it can reflect the ancient times I've never lived.
I love to incorporate this feeling in my work through dramatic landscapes and clothing or figures from other time periods.

This summer I won pre-selections for Kunstbende South Holland, an art event for young creators.
This means I will be exhibiting my work at the Kunstbende finals on 30 september 2023 at De Melkweg in Amsterdam.
